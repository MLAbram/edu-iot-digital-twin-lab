# Week 2: Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Networking 🌐

Last week, your ESP32 made decisions locally. This week, we connect it to the internet so it can report its data to the world.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Connect the virtual ESP32 to a simulated WiFi network.
* Understand the **Publisher/Subscriber** model.
* Send live temperature data to a Public MQTT Broker.

## ⚖️ Step 1: Clone Wokwi Work
1. Open curriculum-iot-digital-twin-celsius-lab-week-1. 
2. Make a copy by clicking on the down arrow next to the grayed out Save button. If your Save button is red, click to save first. Select the Save a copy options and name it: curriculum-iot-digital-twin-celsius-lab-week-2.

## 🛠️ Step 2: The Wokwi WiFi
Wokwi provides a built-in virtual gateway. You don't need to change your wiring from Week 1! We only need to update the library and the code.

## 📚 Step 3: Add the Library
1. In your Wokwi project, click the **Library Manager** tab (the bin icon).
2. Search for and add: **PubSubClient**.
3. Ensure **DHT sensor library for ESPx** is still there from last week.
4. Save your work.

## 💻 Step 4: The Connected Code
Replace your code with this version. This includes the WiFi and MQTT "handshake" logic. 

*(Note: In Wokwi, the WiFi SSID is always "Wokwi-GUEST" with no password.)*

```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <PubSubClient.h>
#include "DHTesp.h"

// WiFi and MQTT Settings
const char* ssid = "Wokwi-GUEST";
const char* password = "";
const char* mqtt_server = "broker.hivemq.com";

WiFiClient espClient;
PubSubClient client(espClient);
DHTesp dhtSensor;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  setup_wifi();
  client.setServer(mqtt_server, 1883);
  dhtSensor.setup(15, DHTesp::DHT22);
}

void setup_wifi() {
  delay(10);
  Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi...");
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }
  Serial.println("\nWiFi Connected!");
}

void reconnect() {
  while (!client.connected()) {
    Serial.print("Attempting MQTT connection...");
    if (client.connect("ESP32_Student_Client")) {
      Serial.println("connected");
    } else {
      delay(5000);
    }
  }
}

void loop() {
  if (!client.connected()) {
    reconnect();
  }
  client.loop();

  TempAndHumidity data = dhtSensor.getTempAndHumidity();
  String tempStr = String(data.temperature, 2);
  
  // Publish data to the cloud!
  Serial.println("Publishing: " + tempStr);
  client.publish("curriculum/iot/temp", tempStr.c_str());

  delay(5000); // Send data every 5 seconds
}
```

Save your work.

## 🧪 Step 5: Verification (The Cloud View)
> [!TIP]
> **Pro-Tip:** To keep this guide open while navigating to **HiveMQ Web Client**, **Right-Click** the links below and select **"Open link in new tab"** (or use Ctrl/Cmd + Click).

To see your data leaving Wokwi and hitting the internet, follow these steps exactly:

1.  Open the [HiveMQ Web Client](https://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/).
2.  **Configure the Connection:**
    * **Host:** `broker.hivemq.com`
    * **Port:** `8884` 
    * **SSL:** ✅ **Must be Checked** (This ensures a secure connection)
    * **ClientID:** Click "Generate ID" to ensure a unique name.
    * **Topic:** `curriculum/iot/temp` Click the double arrows next to Publish
3.  Click the **Connect** button. The status light should turn **Green**.
4.  Click **Add New Topic Subscription**.
5.  **Topic:** `curriculum/iot/temp`
6.  Click **Subscribe**.

### 📝 What to Observe
Adjust the temperature slider in your Wokwi simulation. Within 5 seconds, you should see a new message appear in the HiveMQ "Messages" section showing the updated Fahrenheit value.

> [!TIP]
> **What to look for:** If you see numbers appearing, congratulations! You have successfully created a "Digital Twin" data stream. Your virtual device is now communicating with a global server.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting (If it's not working)

If your Serial Monitor is showing "WiFi Connected" but you don't see data on the website, check these three things:

* **The Connection Button:** Ensure you clicked the **Connect** button on the HiveMQ website *before* subscribing to the topic. If you aren't connected to the broker, you won't see the messages.
* **The Library Manager:** Double-check that `PubSubClient` is listed in your Wokwi Library Manager. If the library is missing, the code cannot "speak" MQTT.
* **Topic Matching:** MQTT topics are case-sensitive. Ensure `curriculum/iot/temp` in your code perfectly matches what you typed into the HiveMQ subscription box.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Client ID Conflict:** MQTT only allows one connection per "Client ID." If the Serial Monitor says "Failed, rc=-2", it might mean someone else is using the ID `RoadTrip_Student_Device`. Try changing that name in your code to something unique (like your name) and restart the simulation.

## 🛰️ How It Works: The "Post Office" Analogy

If you are wondering how your slider movement in a browser gets to another website (HiveMQ) without being "plugged in," think of it like a **Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer** you might use at home.

### **The Home Scenario**
1.  **The Publisher (The Outdoor Sensor):** You hang a sensor outside. Its only job is to measure the temp and "shout" it out over the airwaves. It doesn't know if you are looking at the screen or not.
2.  **The Broker (The Airwaves/Hub):** The data travels through the air. In our lab, the **HiveMQ Broker** acts as the digital "airwaves." It catches the message and holds it.
3.  **The Subscriber (The Indoor Display):** Your kitchen display "listens" for that specific frequency. When it hears the data, it updates the screen.

### **Our Digital Twin Scenario**
* **Wokwi ESP32** = The Outdoor Sensor (Publisher)
* **HiveMQ Cloud** = The Hub (Broker)
* **HiveMQ Web Client** = The Kitchen Display (Subscriber)

> [!TIP]
> **Why this is powerful:** Just like you could add a second display in your bedroom to see the same outdoor temp, we can add a **Python Script** (in Week 3) to "listen" to the same data and save it to a database!
