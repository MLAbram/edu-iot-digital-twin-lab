# Curriculum: IoT Digital Twin Lab

### A 6-Week Full-Stack IoT Experience (Zero Hardware Cost)

Welcome to the **IoT Digital Twin Lab**. This curriculum is designed to take students from basic hardware logic to a professional "Digital Twin" architecture. 

In this course, we remove the "hardware tax." Instead of requiring a Raspberry Pi or expensive sensors, we utilize the **Wokwi** simulator to drive a virtual **ESP32** that communicates with a real-world **PostgreSQL** database and **Python** backend.

## 🚀 Course Highlights
* **Duration:** 6 Weeks
* **Cost:** $0.00 (All tools are free and open-source)
* **Key Tech:** ESP32, MQTT, Python, PostgreSQL, JSON, Grafana/Streamlit
* **Core Concept:** Digital Twin (Virtual hardware syncing with physical data)
